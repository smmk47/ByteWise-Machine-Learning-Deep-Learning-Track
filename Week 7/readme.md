###  In this project, we aimed to predict the prices of used cars using the `pakwheels_used_cars.csv` dataset. The process involved several steps including data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and applying various regression models. Here are the key findings and conclusions:

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **Loading Data**: We loaded the dataset and displayed the first few rows to understand its structure.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values were handled by filling numeric columns with their mean and categorical columns with their mode. This approach ensured that we didn't lose any data and maintained the integrity of the dataset.
- **Data Transformation**: 
  - Categorical variables were converted to numerical values using Label Encoding. This was necessary because most machine learning algorithms require numerical input.
  - Numerical features were standardized using `StandardScaler` to improve model performance. Standardization helped in bringing all features to a similar scale, which is particularly important for algorithms like Support Vector Machines.
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split. This means 80% of the data was used to train the models, and 20% was used to evaluate their performance. The splitting ensures that we can assess how well our models generalize to unseen data.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - We performed EDA to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between different features in the dataset.
  - Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) provided a quick overview of the central tendency and dispersion of the data.
  - Patterns, correlations, and anomalies were identified, which helped in understanding the data better.
- **Visualization**:
  - Histograms were used to show the distribution of individual features.
  - Scatter plots helped visualize relationships between pairs of features.
  - Box plots were useful in identifying outliers and understanding the spread of data.
  - A correlation heatmap highlighted the correlations between features, providing insights into which features might be most predictive of the target variable (price).

### Model Building
We applied four different regression models to the dataset:
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**
3. **Random Forest Regressor**
4. **Support Vector Regressor**

### Model Evaluation
The performance of each model was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test set. The results were as follows:
- **Linear Regression**: MSE = 0.676
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: MSE = 0.549
- **Random Forest Regressor**: MSE = 0.281
- **Support Vector Regressor**: MSE = 0.803

### Discussion
- **Random Forest Regressor**: The Random Forest Regressor performed the best with the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE = 0.281). This can be attributed to its ability to handle both linear and non-linear relationships, as well as its robustness to overfitting due to averaging multiple decision trees.
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: The Decision Tree Regressor also performed reasonably well with an MSE of 0.549, indicating that it can capture complex patterns in the data but may overfit more easily compared to Random Forest.
- **Linear Regression**: Linear Regression had a higher MSE (0.676), which suggests that the relationships between the features and the target variable are not purely linear, making it less effective for this dataset.
- **Support Vector Regressor**: The Support Vector Regressor had the highest MSE (0.803), indicating it struggled with the complexity of the dataset, possibly due to the choice of kernel or hyperparameters.

### Conclusion
Based on the evaluation metrics, the **Random Forest Regressor** emerged as the best model for predicting the prices of used cars in this dataset. Its superior performance can be attributed to its ability to model complex relationships and reduce overfitting through ensemble learning. For future work, we could further optimize the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model and explore other advanced regression techniques such as Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks to potentially improve the prediction accuracy. Additionally, feature engineering and the inclusion of more relevant features could enhance model performance.

Overall, this project provided valuable insights into the data and demonstrated the effectiveness of different regression models in predicting used car prices.
