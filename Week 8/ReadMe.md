### Overview

The notebook file code demonstrates the process of building and evaluating an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The ANN is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and the performance is evaluated with visualizations.

### Data Loading and Preprocessing

1. **Loading the Dataset**:
   - The MNIST dataset is loaded, which contains grayscale images of handwritten digits and their corresponding labels.

2. **Normalization**:
   - Pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255. This helps the model train more effectively by scaling inputs.

3. **One-Hot Encoding**:
   - Labels are converted from integers to one-hot encoded vectors. This is necessary for categorical classification, where each label is represented as a vector of 10 elements (one for each digit), with a 1 in the position of the actual digit and 0s elsewhere.

### Model Building

1. **Model Architecture**:
   - **Flatten Layer**: Converts the 28x28 2D images into a 1D array of 784 pixels.
   - **Dense Layers**: 
     - The first dense layer has 128 neurons with ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation, allowing the model to learn complex patterns.
     - The second dense layer has 64 neurons, also with ReLU activation, adding more learning capacity.
     - The output layer has 10 neurons with softmax activation, providing probabilities for each digit class.

### Model Compilation

- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer is used for adjusting weights during training.
- **Loss Function**: Categorical cross-entropy is chosen, which is appropriate for multi-class classification problems.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy is used to evaluate model performance.

### Model Training

- **Training**: The model is trained on the training data for 5 epochs with a batch size of 32. Validation data is used to monitor performance during training.
- **Epoch-wise Accuracy**: Training and validation accuracies are printed after each epoch to track the model's performance over time.

### Model Evaluation

- **Evaluation**: The model is tested on unseen data (test set) to evaluate its accuracy.
- **Results**: The test accuracy is printed, indicating how well the model performs on new, unseen data.

### Making Predictions

- **Prediction**: The model makes predictions on the test data.
- **Visualization**: 
  - Four test images are displayed in a 2x2 grid.
  - Each image is shown with its predicted label and the actual label.
  - The images are shown in grayscale, with titles indicating the predicted and actual values.

### Summary

This code demonstrates the complete pipeline of building, training, evaluating, and visualizing an ANN for digit classification. It includes data preprocessing, model construction, training, evaluation, and results visualization, providing a comprehensive approach to solving a typical classification problem.
