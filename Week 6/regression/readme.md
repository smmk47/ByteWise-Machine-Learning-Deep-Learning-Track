## This notebook demonstrates a simple machine learning pipeline for predicting used car prices using regression algorithms. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the process:

1. **Imports and Data Loading**:
   - Import necessary libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `sklearn`.
   - Load the dataset from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Handling Missing Values**:
     - Fill missing values in numeric columns with the mean of each column.
     - Fill missing values in categorical columns with the most frequent value (mode).
   - **Encoding Categorical Variables**:
     - Convert categorical variables to numerical using one-hot encoding.
   - **Feature Scaling**:
     - Normalize/standardize numeric features using `StandardScaler`.

3. **Data Splitting**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets with an 80-20 split.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Plot scatter plots to visualize relationships between features (`year`, `engine_cc`, `mileage`) and the target variable (`price`).
   - Add a horizontal line representing the mean price to these plots.

5. **Regression Models**:
   - Apply three regression algorithms: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression.
   - Fit each model to the training data and make predictions on the test data.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Compute and print performance metrics for each model, including:
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - R-squared (R2) Score

These steps cover data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation, providing a comprehensive approach to predicting car prices using regression techniques.

## Conclusion

The performance metrics of the regression models indicate varying degrees of effectiveness in predicting used car prices:

- **Linear Regression**:
  - **MSE**: 8.97e+17 (Very high)
  - **MAE**: 29,418,164.86 (Very high)
  - **R2**: -9.18e+17 (Negative, indicating poor fit)
  
  The Linear Regression model has very high errors (both MSE and MAE) and a negative R2 score, suggesting that it performs poorly on this dataset and does not capture the variability in car prices effectively.

- **Ridge Regression**:
  - **MSE**: 0.37 (Relatively low)
  - **MAE**: 0.24 (Low)
  - **R2**: 0.62 (Moderate to good fit)
  
  Ridge Regression shows significantly better performance with lower MSE and MAE, and a positive R2 score, indicating that it better captures the relationship between features and car prices compared to Linear Regression.

- **Lasso Regression**:
  - **MSE**: 0.98 (Moderately low)
  - **MAE**: 0.46 (Moderate)
  - **R2**: -7.40e-06 (Very close to zero and negative)
  
  Lasso Regression also performs better than Linear Regression but is less effective compared to Ridge Regression, as evidenced by its higher MSE, MAE, and near-zero R2 score.

In summary, Ridge Regression is the most effective model among those tested, providing a better fit for predicting used car prices than both Linear and Lasso Regression models. Adjustments and further tuning might be necessary to improve model performance and address potential issues with feature selection or preprocessing.
